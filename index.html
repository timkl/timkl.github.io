<pre>
@color-blue: #0070b9<br />
@color-blue-dark: #003b7f<br />
@color-blue-light: #0079c2<br />
@color-blue-extra-light: #0080cb<br />
@color-blue-xx-light: #9ee0ff<br />
etc.
</pre>

<p>My need for additional color tints grew and so did the length of the variable names. Say hi to <code>@color-blue-very-very-light</code>! There was a another problem: if I wanted to change the hue of <code>@color-blue</code> I would have to change each and every tint.</p>
<p>An unsustainable situation. Today I found out that LESS (and Sass for that matter) has a <code>lighten</code> and a <code>darken</code> function. That means that I can have a master color (e.g. <code>@color-blue</code>) and use <code>lighten</code> and <code>darken</code> to create the tints:</p>

It&#39;s been a struggle for her, to achieve this man/machine symbiosis, but it was worth it.</p>
<p>Vim is a text editor, but it&#39;s not exactly MS Word. To say that Vim has a steep learning curve would be an understatement. Learning Vim is an investment, but it&#39;s an investment that pays fine dividents. Watching a Vim master type is like watching the guitarist pick chords.</p>
<p>As UX Designers we&#39;re all about ease-of-use, but who&#39;s going to invent the <em>complex</em> tools for tomorrows guitar heroes? Who&#39;s going to invent the next guitar, the next Vim?</p>
<p>I&#39;m not arguing that complexity is a goal in itself, but neither is limiting complexity where it is needed. </p>
<div class="hr"></div></div><div class="post"><h2><a href="posts/fischer-random-chess">Fischer Random Fun</a></h2><p class="date">Dec 5 · 2014</p><div class="clear"></div><p>In the beginning it&#39;s all play. The designers of games are trying things out - having fun, creating. They invent throw-ins, castling and chequered flags. Slowly the games solidify, status quo creeps in, it&#39;s business as usual. That&#39;s why we can&#39;t have a special rule for diving in the penalty area, where you have to wear a ballerina outfit for the rest of the match.</p>
<p>The traditionalists are against ballerina outfits in football games. They want things to be like the last time we played - it was a 1-1 draw and John fell asleep in front of the TV. In another world 1500 years ago, someone woke up, had breakfast and invented chess. For two weeks chess was soft, like clay - nobody cared about memorizing opening variants. A five year old chess prodigy is reading up on the Sicilian right now, but she would have more fun playing Fischer Random Chess, where the pieces on the first row are shuffled. Pokemon figurine to B4 - checkmate!</p>

<p><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiGwAvd5mvM">Citizenfour</a><br />
I remember following Glenn Greenwalds journalism when he was a frequent guest on <a href="http://antiwar.com/radio/">Scott Hortons brilliant podcast</a> on Antiwar.com. He a represents the kind of journalism that is the antidote to the daily sludge of internet memes and &quot;objective&quot; news telegrams. No wonder Edward Snowden turned to him when he wanted to blow the whistle on the government.</p>
<p><a href="http://serialpodcast.org/">Did Adnan do it?</a><br />
Got into <a href="http://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> and binged on 8 episodes in a row. It&#39;s exciting to follow Sarah Koenig and her hunt for truth in a 15 year old murder case, but I also have a nagging concern: what if Adnan <em>is</em> guilty? What happens if reality and drama misaligns?</p>
<p><a href="http://chunk.io/f/4dba8c804b7a4a05bbd095cd437ffa45">Rediscovered Durrty Goodz&#39;s Axiom mixtape</a><br />
The best grime production of all time in my humble opinion. Take the tune <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yave6IZ_4mE">Take Back the Scene</a>, an ode to pirate radio – where Durrty Goodz spits insidous bars on a mean Coki production. Or the flash course in UK Garage that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ufGS8XcUU">Switching Songs Pt. 2</a> – Durrty Goodz shows his wingspan as a vocalist, covering more riddems on a single tune, than man can count. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Qz8_i798M">Give Me The Music</a> tells the story of Goodzys lifelong affair with music, in a poetic and moving way. No one can doubt that music means more to him than sex, jewels and cars.</p>
