I remember following Glenn Greenwalds journalism when he was a frequent guest on <a href="http://antiwar.com/radio/">Scott Hortons brilliant podcast</a> on Antiwar.com. He a represents the kind of journalism that is the antidote to the daily sludge of internet memes and &quot;objective&quot; news telegrams. No wonder Edward Snowden turned to him when he wanted to blow the whistle on the government.</p>
<p><a href="http://serialpodcast.org/">Did Adnan do it?</a><br />
Got into <a href="http://serialpodcast.org/">Serial</a> and binged on 8 episodes in a row. It&#39;s exciting to follow Sarah Koenig and her hunt for truth in a 15 year old murder case, but I also have a nagging concern: what if Adnan <em>is</em> guilty? What happens if reality and drama misaligns?</p>
<p><a href="http://chunk.io/f/4dba8c804b7a4a05bbd095cd437ffa45">Rediscovered Durrty Goodz&#39;s Axiom mixtape</a><br />
The best grime production of all time in my humble opinion. Take the tune <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yave6IZ_4mE">Take Back the Scene</a>, an ode to pirate radio – where Durrty Goodz spits insidous bars on a mean Coki production. Or the flash course in UK Garage that is <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ufGS8XcUU">Switching Songs Pt. 2</a> – Durrty Goodz shows his wingspan as a vocalist, covering more riddems on a single tune, than man can count. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Qz8_i798M">Give Me The Music</a> tells the story of Goodzys lifelong affair with music, in a poetic and moving way. No one can doubt that music means more to him than sex, jewels and cars.</p>
