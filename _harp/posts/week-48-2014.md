A collection of things that tickled my fancy in week 47 →


[Citizenfour](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XiGwAvd5mvM)<br />
I remember following Glenn Greenwalds journalism when he was a frequent guest on [Scott Hortons brilliant podcast](http://antiwar.com/radio/) on Antiwar.com. He a represents the kind of journalism that is the antidote to the daily sludge of internet memes and "objective" news telegrams. No wonder Edward Snowden turned to him when he wanted to blow the whistle on the government.

[Did Adnan do it?](http://serialpodcast.org/)<br />
Got into [Serial](http://serialpodcast.org/) and binged on 8 episodes in a row. It's exciting to follow Sarah Koenig and her hunt for truth in a 15 year old murder case, but I also have a nagging concern: what if Adnan <em>is</em> guilty? What happens if reality and drama misaligns?

[Rediscovered Durrty Goodz's Axiom mixtape](http://chunk.io/f/4dba8c804b7a4a05bbd095cd437ffa45)<br />
The best grime production of all time in my humble opinion. Take the tune [Take Back the Scene](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yave6IZ_4mE), an ode to pirate radio – where Durrty Goodz spits insidous bars on a mean Coki production. Or the flash course in UK Garage that is [Switching Songs Pt. 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=71ufGS8XcUU) – Durrty Goodz shows his wingspan as a vocalist, covering more riddems on a single tune, than man can count. [Give Me The Music](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=u5Qz8_i798M) tells the story of Goodzys lifelong affair with music, in a poetic and moving way. No one can doubt that music means more to him than sex, jewels and cars.
