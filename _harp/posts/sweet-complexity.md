It's hypnotic, to watch the guitarist move her hands over the fretboard. It's been a struggle for her, to achieve this man/machine symbiosis, but it was worth it.

Vim is a text editor, but it's not exactly MS Word. To say that Vim has a steep learning curve would be an understatement. Learning Vim is an investment, but it's an investment that pays fine dividents. Watching a Vim master type is like watching the guitarist pick chords.

As UX Designers we're all about ease-of-use, but who's going to invent the *complex* tools for tomorrows guitar heroes? Who's going to invent the next guitar, the next Vim?

I'm not arguing that complexity is a goal in itself, but neither is limiting complexity where it is needed.
