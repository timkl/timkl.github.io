I often find that I need to add annotation icons to a mockup, to explain what is going on.

I like Skitch's annotation style. The annotations stand out from the mockup -Â you're not in doubt what is the annotation and what is the actual mockup.

I've created a Sketch document with markers inspired by Skitch.
